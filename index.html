      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I build digital products with a bias toward clarity: simple flows, reliable systems, and interfaces that
        explain themselves. My work centers on the intersection of UX research, front-end development, and
        product strategy, especially for teams that need to turn complex information into confident decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about the craft of documentation and the ethics of transparency. When I design a feature,
        I look for the smallest number of steps that still feel human. When I build a tool, I aim for the kind
        of stability that lets people forget the tool exists.

        Use the resume and projects pages to see how I translate those interests into delivered work.
        I keep the site intentionally minimal so the content stays primary.
