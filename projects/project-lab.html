      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Usability Lab standardizes research documentation for teams that run frequent studies.
        It bundles consent tracking, note capture, and synthesis in one repeatable workflow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Research artifacts lived in too many places. Teams struggled to retrieve prior insights and
        had no shared format for naming, tagging, or summarizing sessions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Mapped a full research lifecycle from recruitment to readout.</li>
        <li>Created templates for consent, notes, and insight synthesis.</li>
        <li>Designed a tagging system that supports cross-team retrieval.</li>
        <li>Built a lightweight UI to encourage consistent adoption.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The toolkit shortened synthesis time and improved the quality of research documentation.
        Teams reported faster access to prior findings and fewer redundant studies.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>Notion prototypes, Miro journey maps, stakeholder workshops.</p>
