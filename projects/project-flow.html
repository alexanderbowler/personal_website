      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Workflow Studio maps the moments where work changes hands. It offers a shared timeline
        and vocabulary that keeps product, design, and engineering aligned.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Teams were losing track of ownership during long projects. Hand-offs were implicit and
        progress updates required multiple tools.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Interviewed team leads to identify common points of friction.</li>
        <li>Drafted a visual language for stages, owners, and dependencies.</li>
        <li>Prototyped a timeline that collapses into a clear weekly view.</li>
        <li>Tested with real projects and refined the update workflow.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The tool reduced status-meeting time and clarified role ownership. Teams adopted it as a
        lightweight alternative to heavyweight project management suites.
