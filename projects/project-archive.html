      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Archive Viewer is a browsing experience for a large public collection. The goal was to let
        visitors discover content by topic while keeping the act of reading primary. The interface
        prioritizes clean hierarchy, short paths, and a gentle visual rhythm.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The existing archive had thousands of entries but no clear structure. Visitors were overwhelmed
        and staff spent time answering basic navigation questions. We needed an interface that made the
        collection approachable without dumbing it down.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul class="list-tight">
        <li>Interviewed staff and catalog users to learn how they searched and what stopped them.</li>
        <li>Designed a two-tier navigation system that blends topic filters with free search.</li>
        <li>Built a low-fidelity prototype to test reading flow and metadata clarity.</li>
        <li>Iterated on typography and spacing to support long-form reading.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The prototype reduced time-to-first-item in usability tests and improved confidence in the
        archive structure. The final design became the foundation for a staff-built CMS integration.
